  [[All about cold start latency in serverless]]
## Abstract 
Serverless computing has revolutionised the way applications are built and deployed, offering scalability, cost-effectiveness and ease of management. However, the promise of serverless computing is often hindered by the debilitating effects of cold start latency, which significantly impacts application performance and user experience. This paper presents SWIFT-serverless, a novel framework designed to mitigate cold start latency in serverless environments. By analysing the root causes of cold start latency and leveraging four key techniques - proactive function initialisation, optimised container reuse, accelerated code preloading- SWIFT - Serverless significantly reduces the overhead associated with serverless workload initialisation, enabling faster and more responsive application execution.

## Introduction
Serverless computing has emerged as a paradigm-shifting technology, enabling developers to build and deploy applications without the burden of server management , The serverless model offers numerous benefits, including scalability, cost-effectiveness, and enhanced productivity. However, the serverless promise is often compromised by the phenomenon of cold start latency, which refers to the delayed response times experienced by applications during initial invocation. Cold start latency is a critical performance bottleneck, impacting application
