And mainly what is the problem I currently stating [[All about cold start latency in serverless]]
## Abstract 
Serverless computing has revolutionised the way applications are built and deployed, offering scalability, cost-effectiveness and ease of management. However, the promise of serverless computing is often hindered by the debilitating effects of cold start latency, which significantly impacts application performance and user experience. This paper presents SWIFT-serverless, a novel framework designed to mitigate cold start latency in serverless environments. By analysing the root causes of cold start latency and leveraging four key techniques - proactive function initialisation, optimised container reuse, accelerated code preloading- SWIFT - Serverless significantly reduces the overhead associated with serverless workload initialisation, enabling faster and more responsive application execution.

## Introduction
Serverless computing has emerged as a paradigm-shifting technology, enabling developers to build and deploy applications without the burden of server management . The serverless model offers numerous benefits, including scalability, cost-effectiveness, and enhanced productivity. However, the serverless promise is often compromised by the phenomenon of cold start latency, which refers to the delayed response times experienced by applications during initial invocation. Cold start latency is a critical performance bottleneck, impacting application responsiveness, user experience, and ultimately business success. This research aims ti address the challenges posed by cold start latency in serverless environments proposing a novel framework, SWIFT - Serverless, designed to optimise serverless workload initialisation and minimise latency. By exploring the underlying factors contributing to cold start latency and introducing innovative techniques to mitigate its effects, SWIFT paves the way for faster, more efficient and more responsive serverless application execution.

# Here are few ideas for minimising the latency

> Note this ideas have been taken from various sources I will be adding the reference links too !!

- Utilise provisioned concurrency to keep functions warm and ready to respond quickly
	- Imagine having a team of experts on standby, ready to jump into action at a moment's notice. That's what provisioned concurrency does for serverless functions !! By keeping a pool of pre-initialised functions warm and ready, we can drastically cut down response times. This technique ensures that your functions are always primed to handle incoming requests, eliminating the delay caused by cold starts. With provisioned concurrency, your applications can react swiftly, providing a seamless user experience. It's like having a rapid response team at your back and call, ensuring your serverless functions are always ready to spring into action ! 
- Use smaller, more focused functions to reduce the amount of code that need to be initialised.
	- Trying to start a massive truck engine just to drive a short distance. Its inefficient ! Similarly, in serverless functions, initialising a lot of code for a small task can be wasteful. By breaking down functions into smaller, focused tasks, we can reduce the amount of code that needs to be started up. This is like using scooter for short trips instead of the massive trucks. Smaller functions mean less overheard, faster startups, and reduced latency. It's a simple yet effective way to make serverless applications more efficient and responsive, just like choosing
-  Employ caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data to reduce the need for repeated cold starts. 
	- Think of caching like a shortcut to your favourite coffee shop. Instead of navigating through the entire city (making a cold start), you can take a quick detour to grab your coffee (access cached data). By storing frequently accessed data in a cache, we can avoid repeated cold starts and reduce latency
- Optimise function configuration and dependencies to minimise startup time.
- Implement strategies such as deploying warm-up requests periodically to maintain a certain level of readiness
- Consider using serverless container options for more control over initialisation times 
- Evaluate the trade-offs of different programming language and runtimes in terms of cold performance
- Monitor cold start time and analyse patterns to identify opportunities for improvement.
- Explore the use of serverless application frameworks that offer built-in optimisation for reducing cold start latency.
