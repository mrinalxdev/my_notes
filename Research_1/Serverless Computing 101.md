This is were you will learn Serverless computing from the basics. First I will start with a rough sketch of the pdf then will finish it off with 

What is Serverless Architecture ?
	Like wise we can define serverless computing as a cloud computing execution model which dynamically allocates the machine resources, so that developers can run the code without managing the servers. Its main key feature is instead of paying pre-allocated resources develoepr are billed based on the actual amount of resources consumed by the application. 
When to use Serverless ?
Why to use Serverless ?
	Serverless comes up with some amazing and non negotiable key features such as automatic scaling, Built-in high availability, Pay-per-Use Billing Model, Event-Driven Architecture. 
How to use Serverless ?

## Brief intro to key features 
 - **Automatic scaling** : it means that the serverless platform automatically adjusts the compute resources based on the current demand. If the traffic spikes, additional resources are allocated; if demand drops, resources are reduced, ensuring optimal performance without manual intervention. 
 - **Built-in High Availability** : it ensures that the serverless platform fault tolerance and redundancy. Application
